<p><b><font size="+1">Mastercourse Applied Statistics: Nonparametric methods Wi 4206</font><br>
</b></p>
<b>Course overview:<br>
</b>The aim of this course it to obtain a broad knowledge of
nonparametric methods in statistics. Many methods in statistics are
parametric in nature. In this case the probability law of the data is
assumed to be parametrized by a finite-dimensional parameter. The basic
idea of nonparametric methods is to drop this often restrictive
assumption. These methods thereby offer much more flexibility to model
the data than classical parametric methods. The topics that we will
cover in this course form a mix of classical distribution free methods
and more modern topics. The focus is both on the application and theory
of these methods. Examples will be illustrated using the statistical
computing tools, namely the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">statistical computing package R</a>. There are many tutorials on R on the internet, for example <a href="RforBeginners.pdf" target="_blank">R for beginners</a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="RShort-refcard.pdf" target="_blank">R short reference card</a></span><i>.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><b>Time schedule:<br>
</b>Lectures start at 13:00 and are in the Buys Ballot Lab. room BBL 079 of the University of Utrecht on<br>
februari: 6, 13, 20 <br>
march: 5, 12, 19*, 26 <br>
april: 2, 16, 23 <br>
may: 7, 14<br><br>
Each class consists roughly of two 45 minutes time slots. After the
lecture there is an optional one hour slot (15:00 - 16:00) in the same room, that
will be used for discussing the exercises, course contents and related
materials. In this hour I will not discuss new material. It serves merely as "office hours". <br>

The contents of the course will be taken from various sources (e.g.
lectures notes / slides / articles). Part of the material will follow
closely the book <br>
"All of Nonparametric Statistics" (Springer; author: L. Wasserman, "ISBN-10:" 0387251456)<br>

</ol><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span><br>
Basic knowledge of probability and statistics, and a sufficient level of mathematical maturity. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam: (june 4, 13.30-16.30 EDUCATORIUM BETAZAAL, Utrecht University)<br>
</span>The exam will potentially cover all the materials lectured. The
emphasis is likely more on the use and understanding of the concepts
and tools learned during the course than on encyclopedic knowledge. A
good way to prepare for the exam is to review the homework exercises
and all the results derived in class ensuring you understand both WHY
and HOW each result was derived or concept was introduced. <br>
<br>
INSTRUCTIONS: <br>
<ul>
  <li>This is an OPEN NOTES exam. You can bring all the materials distributed in class, plus the book by L. Wasserman we use.</li>
  <li>In addition, you can bring any MANUSCRIPT PERSONAL NOTES (other books, or copies of books are not allowed).</li>
  <li>The exam is to be done INDIVIDUALLY. Therefore discussion with your fellow colleagues during the exam is not allowed!</li>
  <li>You can use a calculator. Cellphones, notebooks or similar devices are not allowed.</li>
  <li>You have 180 minutes (3 hours) to complete the exam.</li>
  <li>The problems are not necessarily in order of difficulty. I
recommend that you quickly read through all problems first, then do the
problems in whatever order suits you best.</li>
  <li>A correct answer does not guarantee full credit, and a wrong
answer does not guarantee loss of credit. You should clearly and
concisely indicate your reasoning and show all relevant work. Your
grade on each problem will be based on my best assessment of your level
of understanding as reflected by what you have written. JUSTIFY your
answers and be CRITICAL of your results.</li>
  <li>Please be organized in your write-up &#8211; I cannot grade properly if I cannot follow your reasoning.<br>
  </li>
